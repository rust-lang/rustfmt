<!--
Please note that rustfmt's core scope is to pretty-print a parsed program's AST
according to the rules defined in the Rust Style Guide. Supporting this function
and its associated maintenance takes top priority. Any other features, such as
auxiliary formatting configuration options, are secondary to that core mission.
